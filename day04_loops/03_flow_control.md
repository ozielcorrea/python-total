## Control flow

Refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated. It is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and funtion calls, allowing programmers to specify how the program should act in response to specific circumstances and take appropiate action.
This concept is fundamental in programming as it enables devlopers to write programs that can make decisions based on certain conditions, making thep programs more flexible and adaptable.

```python
if 5 > 10:
  print("5 is greater than 10")
elif 5 == 10:
  print("5 is equal to 10")
else:
  print("t is less than 10")
```
