# Mathematic operations

```
x = 6
y = 2
z = 7
```

1. Addition
   `print(f"{x} plus {y} equals {x+y}")`
2. Substraction
   `print(f"{x} minus {y} equals {x-y}")`
3. Multiplication
   `print(f"{x} times {y} equals {x*y}")`
4. Division
   `print(f"{x} divided {y} equals {x/y}")`

- Floor division: It is a mathematical operation that divides two numbers and rounds the result down to the nearest integer. For example:
  `print"The floor division of {z} by {y} is {z//y}")`

5. Modulo
   This operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another
   `print(f"{z} modulo {y} is {z%y}")`

6. Power
   `print(f"{x} raised to the power of {y} is {x**y}")`

7. Root
   `print(f"The square root of {x} is {x**0.5}")`
