# Print statement

Print is a method that prints a message to the screen. Example:

`print("Hello world")`

To put quotes you can alternate single quotes with double quotes or vice versa:

`print("Hello world, my name is 'Jorge'")`

The message can be a string, but also another object. but the object will be converted to a string before being written to the screen:

`print(150) or print(100+50)`
