# Strings

Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotes, or double quotes:

`print("hello guys")`

You can also use the backslash "\" to escape quotes inside a string:
`print("Hello world, my name is \"Jorge\"")`

"\n" is used for a line break.
`print('This is my first line\nThis is my second line')`

"\t" is an escape sequence that represents a tab character. When used within a string, it inserts a horizontal tab at that position:
`print('Hello\tWorkd')`

To assign a string to a variable:
`a = "Hello"`

You can also assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

```
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consctetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt""""
```
