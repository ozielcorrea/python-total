# Object-Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects, which can contain data and code data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in form of procedures (often known as methods). In OOP, computer progams are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. This paradigm is widely used and supported by many programming languages such as C++, Java, Python.

## What is a paradigm?

The word paradigm has its roots in Greek, derived from "paradeigma", meaning "pattern" or "model", which is a combination of "para" (beside) and "deiknymi" (to show). This etymology reflects the concept of a paradigm as a representative example of framework for understanding.
Some synonyms of paradigm include model, framework, pattern, and archetype, all of which convey the idea of a conceptual structure or a standard example that guides thought or behavior.

## Purpose

The purpose of the object-oriented paradigm was to adress the problems commonly grouped together as the "software crisis", which manifested itself in the complexity of large software projects. This complexity led to many problems, and OOP was seen as a way to organize and group methods and data structures into 'objects' that can be taken, reused, and inherited across different pieces of software.

- Simula: A language that introduces foundational concepts such as classes, objects and inheritance.
- Smalltalk: A language that advanced the OOP paradigm and introduced concepts such as encapsulation and polymomphism.
